# Disaster-Assistant-System
Final Year Project
#Introduction:-
Disaster Assistance System (DAS) is a web application in which the system’s focus on estimating accurately the damage due to the disaster with the help of old data collected from such previous events. This project is not research work instead it will use pre invented machine learning algorithms and old data to estimate the damage caused by a disaster. This system will provide the information to end-users about how much damage will occur approximately. The proposed system will utilize the state of the art data analytics, natural language processing, and machine learning technique in order to assess the aforementioned damages. This system, it will be a great help for:
•	Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
•	National Weather Service (NWS)
•	Department of Energy (DOE)
•	Department of Labor (DOL)
•	National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)

##DAS deals in following four main areas of disaster assistance:
 
•	Earthquake damage estimation
•	Flood damage estimation
•	Awareness about Earthquake
•	Awareness about Flood
•	Weather with Alert
•	Live News of all Disasters
•	Live mapping
•	Events with graphical representation
•	Blogs
